   We live in a world where driving is the standard way of transportation. Accordingly, various map service providers make use of massive traffic data and metadata to predict the real-time fastest driving route between two specific geographic coordinates, often also known as ‘navigation services’.  It collects real-time traffic information and optimizes the shortest path to the endpoint with shortest time.
   
  However, predicting a future time’s fastest driving route has not been as fast growing; Google Maps launched a service on December 2017 that predicts the fastest driving route for only a 3-hour future timeframe. If extended to a further timeframe, 24-hour daily prediction or a 7-day weekly prediction becomes possible.
  
   In this study, we integrate historical weather metadata with historical traffic congestion data to train suitable machine learning algorithms and perform a statistical test to assess the performance. Then, with the optimal model, we make prediction about a specified day of the week and ultimately, predict a future 7-day timeframe’s fastest driving routes similarly to a commonly known 7-day weather forecast.
